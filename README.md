# Simple Linear Regression – Salary Prediction

This project implements a **Simple Linear Regression** model using Python's `scikit-learn` library to predict salary based on years of experience.

## 📌 Objective

The objective of this notebook is to:
- Understand and implement Simple Linear Regression from scratch using `sklearn`.
- Train the model on a sample salary dataset.
- Visualize the regression line on training and testing datasets.
- Make salary predictions based on new experience values.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset used contains:
- `YearsExperience`: Number of years of professional experience.
- `Salary`: Corresponding salary in USD.

It’s a small, clean dataset, perfect for learning regression basics.

## 📈 Visualizations

The notebook includes:
- Scatter plots of training/testing sets.
- A regression line over the data.
- Predictions compared with actual test values.
